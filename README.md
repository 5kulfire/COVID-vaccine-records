Place css file in CSS folder, javascript file in JS folder and json in JSON folder. The images folder has 2 images, one for background and one for title icon. 
The objective of this project is to create a webpage with two buttons. 
the aim of Load LocalStorage button is to load ajax and store the dates in the local storage. The display list button will show an unordered list of the dates fetched from the local storage.
The display details section will show the information about whatever date the user choose, by clicking on a list item.

The buttons do not work and I am not sure why. I have coded everything the way it should be, but the buttons don't work.
